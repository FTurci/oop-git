The solutions to the **Implementation** workshop can be downloaded as a git bundle from here:

- [ðŸ“’ Implementation.bundle](../bundles/Implementation.bundle)

## How to use the bundle

First, download the bundle and clone it locally on you machine with

```bash
git clone Implementation.bundle
```

Then you will be able to see all the branches and commits of the bundle.

In particular, an easy way to navigate the solutions is to use the tags: the bundle contains so-called `git` tags, which are shortcuts to commits. You can see all the tags by typing

```bash
git tag
```

inside your cloned repository.


You have two main parts for this workshop:

- The tasks of *Hands on objects and classes* are labelled `3.x` where x is the number of the task
- The tasks of *Completing the OOP design of the project* are labelled `3.x` where x is the number of the task

To access the state of the repository for a particular task just use `git checkout <task-number>`. So, for example, to access task 4 

```bash
git checkout 3.4
```

You can always go back to the main branch with

```bash
git checkout main
```
