# Creating a Makefile



The code in this folder can be compiled using

```
g++ main.cpp pgcalculator.cpp -o program
```



However, the goal here is to construct a `Makefile` so that your compilation command will only be 

`make`



Follow the Seminar's instructions to 

- write down a minimal Makefile to compile the project
- run the resulting executable
- improve your Makefile to be more generic
