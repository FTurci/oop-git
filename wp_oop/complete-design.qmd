## Aims


- Complete the skeleton of the object-oriented structure of the project

## Learning outcomes

- Constructing combinations of objects
- Constructing vectors of objects


## More classes

Up to now, we only create one class, the `System` class. We could maybe write all out code inside the system class, but this would largely defeat the point of object-oriented programming.

The idea behind this programming paradigm is to organise the code into smaller units taht can be quite autonomous but which can interact with each other.

Earlier we drew the following sketch


```{mermaid}
classDiagram
 direction LR
    class System{
      %% particle_number
      %% noise_strength
      %%list~Particle~ particles
      %%update_rule()
  
    }

    class Box {
        %%size
        %%boundary_conditions
    }

    class Particle {
        %%position
        %%orientation
    }
  System --> Box : contains
  System "1" --> "N" Particle : contains

```

In the [previous part](oop.qmd) of this workshop we addressed only one of these objects, the `System` class.

We now proceed more quickly, using the same ideas, to construct the two remaining objects and see how to integrate them with our original `System` class.

Here, there will be less detailed code and more **high level** description of what the classes do: it will be for you to translate these design choices int actual code.


## Constructing the `Box`

The system is simulated in a two-dimensional domain. We decide the domain to be a square box. However, for the sake of generality, let our `Box` class represent an arbitrary **rectangular** domain.

The rectangle should have are 

- the side in the x direction
- the side in the y direction
- the coordinates of the origin (bottom left corner)

```{=html}
<svg width="300" height="200">
  <!-- Draw rectangle -->
  <rect x="50" y="50" width="200" height="100" style="fill:none;stroke:black;stroke-width:2" />
  
  <!-- Label for side x -->
  <text x="150" y="45" font-family="Arial" font-size="12" fill="black" text-anchor="middle">side x</text>
  
  <!-- Label for side y -->
  <text x="10" y="120" font-family="Arial" font-size="12" fill="black" text-anchor="middle" transform="rotate(-90 10,100)">side y</text>
  
  <!-- Origin label -->
  <text x="50" y="170" font-family="Arial" font-size="12" fill="black" text-anchor="middle" dy="-5">Origin</text>
    
  <!-- Small circle at bottom-left corner -->
  <circle cx="50" cy="150" r="5" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

In this case we want to make these properties accessible only via the usage of member functions: we want them to be **private** member variables. This avoids possible accidental changes, making the code more robust.

This means that, when we define the `Box` class, we will use the following syntax

```cpp
private:
    double sidex;
    double sidey;
    double x0;
    double y0;
```

To set the values of these variables or get their values we need dedicated member functions, conventionally called **setters** and **getters**. These, obviously, have to be **public**.

```cpp
public:
    void setSides(double lx, double ly);
    void setOrigin(double x, double y);
    double getSidex();
    double getSidey();

```
## Multiple constructors

C++ can be initialised i  various ways using different constructors. Indeed, in the same class definition, we can have both a default constructor (e.g. without parameters) and various parametrised constructors. A minimal example follows:

```cpp
public:
    Box(); //default constructor with no parameters
    Box(double lx, double ly, double x0, double y0); //parametrised constructor
```

Both will require a suitable implementation in the `cpp` file:

```cpp

Box::Box(){
    // an empty constructor
}
Box::Box(double lx, double ly, double x0, double y0){
     //this constructor actually assigns values
     this->sidex = lx;
    //  ...
}

```

## Task 1: Construct the `Box` class

Inspired by what you have done for the `System` class, create a `box.h` and a `box.cpp` file to declare and implement the `Box` class.

Follow the recommendations above to structure the `Box` class, with private member variables and public getters and setters.

In particular, provide both a parametrised constructor that takes four parameters:
```cpp
    Box(double lx, double ly, double x0, double y0);
```
as well as a default constructor.

## Task 2: Use the  `Box`

Go back to your `System` class and uncomment the parts of the code that pertain to the `Box` class. 

Since we have defined the class and implented it, we can now use it. In particular we want that, when we construct a `System`, the `Box` is also constructed using the correct parameters for its side. We also choose the point (0,0) to always be  its lower left corner.

Hence, modify the implementation of the `System` class so that the member variable `simulationBox` is an instance of the parametrised constructor of the `Box` class, using `sideLength` for both `lx` and `ly` parameters and `0,0` for `x0` and `y0`.

To check that your implementation is valid, add the following line to your `main.cpp` file to print the side of the box:

```cpp
std::cout<<"The system has a simulation box of side "<<model.simulationBox.getSidex()<<std::endl;
```
The compilation step is now
```bash
g++ main.cpp simulation.cpp box.cpp -o myvicsek
```
If you instead have prepared a correct makefile, just type

```bash
make
```

## Constructing a `Particle`

The final object we are interested in possibly the most important: it is the  particle, representing the individual agent of the Vicsek model.

The model uses point particles with an associated velocity vector of fixed magnitude but variable angle. This vectors move in space and eventually interact with each other within a radius of interaction $r$.

Therefore, we simply want a new class that describes objects that contain:

- an `x` coordinate
- a `y` coordinate
- an angle `theta`
- a velocity magnitude `v`
- a radius of interaction `r`

We shall have all these variables `public` for simplicity.

we should also decide how these properties get initialised when we create a new particle. We have many options, but the simplest choice could be to assign default values via the default constructor. 

Reasonable choices are the following:
-  zero both `x`, `y` and `theta`
- set `r` as the out unit of length
- set `v` to `0.5`

This can be directly done in the implementation of the default constructor `Particle()`, with no parameters.

## Task 3: Construct the `Particle` class

Inspired by what you have done for the `System` class and the `Box` class, create a `particle.h` and a `particle.cpp` file to declare and implement the `particle` class.

Use the guidance above to structure your class. It should be sufficient then to uncomment the relevant section of code in `system.h` to test that the code is valid to proceed with a compilation. 

Without a makefile this is

```bash
g++ main.cpp system.cpp box.cpp particle.cpp -o myvicsek
```

If you have not done it already, thi is a good time to create makefile to help yourself with future compilations. A valid makefile can be downloaded here [📝 Makefile](Makefile). Put it in the same directory of your project and type 

```bash
make
```

every time you need to compile your code. For more information, see [here](../wp_gitgithub/make.qmd).

## Minimal inheritance: `SquareBox` class

A key idea of object-oriented programming is the notion of **inheritance**: we can design fairly generic base classes and then **derive** classes from them that get more specialised. 

We will only cover this superficially, but our `Box` class lends itself naturally to this kind of specialisation. Indeed, we are going to use the same `box.cpp` and `box.h` files to contain another class, derived from `Box` but that fits the purpose of a square simulation domain. We call it `SquareBox` and as derived class from `Box` it is declared with the following syntax:

```cpp
class SquareBox : public Box{
    // rest of the declaration as usual
}
```
