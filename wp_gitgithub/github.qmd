Disclaimer: setting up a remote repository is **OPTIONAL**. You can skip this section if you wish.

## Aims

- Synchronise your local repository with a remote Github repository

## Learning outcomes

- Undrestand how to use the command line tool `gh` to create a remote repositoory and link it to a local one


## Remote repositories

`git` can be used exclusively locally and it is completely fine to do so. It can be useful however to also have a **remote** (online) repository, to easily share it with others and to have a dematerialiased storage.

There are many services that can be used for this purpose. For example:

1. **GitHub**  
   [https://github.com](https://github.com)  
   The most popular platform for hosting Git repositories, offering robust collaboration tools, CI/CD, and integrations.

2. **GitLab**  
   [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)  
   Open-source DevOps platform that can be used as a hosted service or self-hosted for full control. It includes CI/CD pipelines and project management tools.

3. **Codeberg**  
   [https://codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org)  
   A community-driven, non-profit platform for hosting Git repositories, focused on privacy and open-source principles.


## Setting up a Github account
For convenience we will use **Github**. For this, you need a Github account. 

To set up a GitHub account, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Go to GitHub's Website**
Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com).

---

### 2. **Sign Up**
Click the **"Sign up"** button in the top-right corner of the homepage.

---

### 3. **Create an Account**
- **Enter your details**:
  - **Email address**: Provide a valid email.
  - **Password**: Choose a strong password.
  - **Username**: Pick a unique username (visible to others).
- **Solve CAPTCHA**: Complete the CAPTCHA to verify you’re human.
- **Click "Create account"**.

---

### 4. **Verify Your Email**
Check your email inbox for a verification email from GitHub. Click the verification link to activate your account.

## Using `gh` to create a remote repository linked to your local repository

To set up a remote repository on GitHub from a local one using the `gh` command-line utility, follow these steps:

### 1. **Install `gh` (if not already installed)**  

Follow the instructions provided in the [welcome page](../index.qmd). Further information can be found at the [GitHub CLI installation page](https://cli.github.com/).


### 2. **Authenticate `gh`**  
   Run the following command to log in to GitHub:  

```bash
    gh auth login
```  
   Follow the prompts to authenticate.

---

### 3. **Navigate to Your Local Repository**  
   Open a terminal and move into your local repository:  
   
```bash
   cd /path/to/your/local-repo
```

---

### 4. **Create a Remote Repository on GitHub**  
   Run the following command to create a new repository on GitHub:  

```bash
   gh repo create
```
    This will prompt you with several options: 
```bash
    ? What would you like to do?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
    Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch
    Create a new repository on GitHub from a template repository
    > Push an existing local repository to GitHub
```

    - Select the **last one** ("Push an existing local repository to GitHub").
    - Then, press **ENTER** when asked for the path to the local directory (it should be the directory you are in, hence the path is `.`).
    - Choose a suitable repository name and yourself as the owner
    - Skip the description (or provide a brief one)
    - Set the visibility to *public*
    - Add a remote and leave the default name **(origin)**
    - Finally push the commits.

Example of the creation of a repository called `temporary`
```bash
    ? What would you like to do? Push an existing local repository to GitHub
    ? Path to local repository .
    ? Repository name temporary
    ? Repository owner FTurci
    ? Description 
    ? Visibility Public
    ✓ Created repository FTurci/temporary on GitHub
    https://github.com/FTurci/temporary
    ? Add a remote? Yes
    ? What should the new remote be called? origin
    ✓ Added remote https://github.com/FTurci/temporary.git
    ? Would you like to push commits from the current branch to "origin"? Yes

    * [new branch]      HEAD -> main
    branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
    ✓ Pushed commits to https://github.com/FTurci/temporary.git
```

---

### 5. **Verify the Setup**  
   Check that the remote repository is correctly set up:  

```bash
    git remote -v
```

That's it! Your local repository is now linked to a remote repository on GitHub.
